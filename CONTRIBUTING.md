# Contributing to All App

Thank you for your interest in contributing! üéâ  

**All App** is an open-source collection of **mini React projects and reusable components** that demonstrate important React concepts.  
The goal is to create a **learning playground** where anyone can explore, improve, and add new concepts.

We welcome:
- New concepts/components
- Improvements to existing demos
- Accessibility, performance, and code readability fixes
- Documentation updates

3. **Create a new branch for your work**  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<your-concept-name>

4. **Add your concept under:**
   - Export a main component (`index.jsx` or `<YourConcept>.jsx`).
   - Keep the code focused and well-named.

   - Uncomment it to preview in the browser.

6. **Commit and Push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add <YourConcept> demo"
   git push origin feature/<your-concept-name>
7. **Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to main:**
   - Clear title (e.g., feat: add InfiniteScroll demo)
   - Short description of what/why
8. **PR Guidelines:**
   - Keep PRs small and focused.
   - Prefer reusable components (use props instead of hardcoding).
   - Add basic error handling and accessibility where possible.
   - If you change existing code, explain why (performance, bug fix, readability, etc.).
9. **Ideas for New Concepts:**
    - Form with validation (React Hook Form / Zod)
    - Modren Data fetching patterns (eg: React Query)
    - Error boundaries & Suspense
    - Accessibility examples (focus trap, ARIA)
    - Many more ...

## Final Note
